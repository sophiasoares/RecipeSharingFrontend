# Recipe Sharing Project

This is the frontend part of a small full stack application.
The frontend was developed using Angular v17 and the backend using Spring Boot.

In this application you can see a list of recipes, add, update and delete recipes.
You can also search for terms (recipe names) and see the recipe details (name, description, creation date, ingredients and instructions).
